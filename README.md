# OneLastCube
Created for the GameZanga 2018, One Last Cube is built with the intention for it to become a fast paced rope-swinging missile dodging side 
platformer!

A story hasn't been developed yet, but if it were, it will tackle the "One-ness" and "Last-ness" of this pure little cube.

Space Nugget, however, is working on a similar game inspired by One Last Cube.
