Density: The density of something is defined as its mass per unit volume, which basically means 
how much mass is crammed into the space it takes up in the world.

Restitution: Restitution is really a way of saying how "bouncy" the fixture is. This setting will 
affect how much an object "bounces" when it collides with other objects and is co-dependant on 
other forces that act on the instance like gravity and friction.

Collision Group: The collision group can be used to force GameMaker Studio 2 to treat collisions 
in specific ways.

Linear Damping: Damping is used to reduce the physics world velocity of an instance as it moves 
over time (like air resistance).

Angular Damping: As above, only instead affecting the velocity of movement, this sets the slow 
down rate for the angular velocity.

Friction: Friction sets the loss of momentum caused by the collision of two instances with fixtures 
bound to them. The lower the value, the easier it is for one colliding instance to "slide" off the other.
